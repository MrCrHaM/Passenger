abstract = {We give a novel spectral approximation algorithm for the balanced separator problem that, given a graph G, a constant balance b $\backslash$in (0,1/2], and a parameter $\backslash$gamma, either finds an $\backslash$Omega(b)-balanced cut of conductance O($\backslash$sqrt($\backslash$gamma)) in G, or outputs a certificate that all b-balanced cuts in G have conductance at least $\backslash$gamma, and runs in time $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m). This settles the question of designing asymptotically optimal spectral algorithms for balanced separator. Our algorithm relies on a variant of the heat kernel random walk and requires, as a subroutine, an algorithm to compute $\backslash$exp(-L)v where L is the Laplacian of a graph related to G and v is a vector. Algorithms for computing the matrix-exponential-vector product efficiently comprise our next set of results. Our main result here is a new algorithm which computes a good approximation to $\backslash$exp(-A)v for a class of PSD matrices A and a given vector u, in time roughly $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m\_A), where m\_A is the number of non-zero entries of A. This uses, in a non-trivial way, the result of Spielman and Teng on inverting SDD matrices in $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m\_A) time. Finally, we prove e\^{}\{-x\} can be uniformly approximated up to a small additive error, in a non-negative interval [a,b] with a polynomial of degree roughly $\backslash$sqrt\{b-a\}. While this result is of independent interest in approximation theory, we show that, via the Lanczos method from numerical analysis, it yields a simple algorithm to compute $\backslash$exp(-A)v for PSD matrices that runs in time roughly O(t\_A $\backslash$sqrt\{||A||\}), where t\_A is the time required for computation of the vector Aw for given vector w. As an application, we obtain a simple and practical algorithm, with output conductance O($\backslash$sqrt($\backslash$gamma)), for balanced separator that runs in time $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m/$\backslash$sqrt($\backslash$gamma)). This latter algorithm matches the running time, but improves on the approximation guarantee of the algorithm by Andersen and Peres.},
